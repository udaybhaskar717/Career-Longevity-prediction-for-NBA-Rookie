Understand the Problem Statement and Import the Packages and Datasets
Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) – Understanding the Datasets.
Explore Train and Test Data and get to know what each Column / Feature denotes. Check for Imbalance of Target Column in Datasets
Check for Duplicate Rows from Train Data
Fill/Impute Missing Values – Continuous – Mean/Median/Any Specific Value | Categorical – Others/ForwardFill/BackFill
Feature Engineering – Feature Selection – Selection of Most Important Existing Features | Feature Creation or Binning  – Creation of New Feature(s) from the Existing Feature(s)
Split Train Data into Features(Independent Variables) | Target(Dependent Variable)
Data Encoding – Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding | Data Scaling – MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler, RobustScaler
Create Baseline Machine Learning Model for the Binary Classification problem
Ensemble with Voting Classifier to Improve the Evaluation Metric “F1-Score” and Predict Target “is_promoted”
Result Submission, Check Leaderboard, and Improve “F1-Score”
